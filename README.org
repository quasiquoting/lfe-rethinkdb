RethinkDB driver in LFE.

*NEEDS A NEW NAME*

** Introduction
Initially based on [[https://github.com/kureikain][@kureikain]]'s [[https://github.com/kureikain/relang][version]], but it's already changed a lot
and is phasing out
- vanilla Erlang, in favor of LFE
- simple functions, in favor of a more structured (=gen_server=?) approach
- (seemingly) manual records and macros, in favor of Protocol Buffers

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

https://github.com/taybin/lethink especially on the query syntax.
